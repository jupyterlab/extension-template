{{ project_short_description }}
{% if kind.lower() == 'frontend-and-server' %}
This extension is composed of a Python package named `{{ python_name }}`
for the server extension and a NPM package named `{{ labextension_name }}`
for the frontend extension.
{% endif %}
## Requirements

- JupyterLab >= 4.0.0

## Install

To install the extension, execute:

```bash
pip install {{ python_name }}
```

## Uninstall

To remove the extension, execute:

```bash
pip uninstall {{ python_name }}
```
{% if kind.lower() == 'frontend-and-server' %}
## Troubleshoot

If you are seeing the frontend extension, but it is not working, check
that the server extension is enabled:

```bash
jupyter server extension list
```

If the server extension is installed and enabled, but you are not seeing
the frontend extension, check the frontend extension is installed:

```bash
jupyter labextension list
```
{% endif %}
## Contributing

### Development install

Note: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.

The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.

```bash
# Clone the repo to your local environment
# Change directory to the {{ python_name }} directory
# Install package in development mode
pip install -e ".{% if test and kind.lower() == 'frontend-and-server' %}[test]{% endif %}"
# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite{% if kind.lower() == 'frontend-and-server' %}
# Server extension must be manually installed in develop mode
jupyter server extension enable {{ python_name }}{% endif %}
# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes
jlpm build
```

You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.

```bash
# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed
jlpm watch
# Run JupyterLab in another terminal
jupyter lab
```

With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).

By default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:

```bash
jupyter lab build --minimize=False
```

### Development uninstall

```bash{% if kind.lower() == 'frontend-and-server' %}
# Server extension must be manually disabled in develop mode
jupyter server extension disable {{ python_name }}{% endif %}
pip uninstall {{ python_name }}
```

In development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`
command. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`
folder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `{{ labextension_name }}` within that folder.

### Testing the extension{% if kind.lower() == 'frontend-and-server' %}

#### Server tests

This extension is using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for Python code testing.

Install test dependencies (needed only once):

```sh
pip install -e ".[test]"
# Each time you install the Python package, you need to restore the front-end extension link
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
```

To execute them, run:

```sh
pytest -vv -r ap --cov {{ python_name }}
```{% endif %}

#### Frontend tests

This extension is using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript code testing.

To execute them, execute:

```sh
jlpm
jlpm test
```

#### Integration tests

This extension uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) for the integration tests (aka user level tests).
More precisely, the JupyterLab helper [Galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/galata) is used to handle testing the extension in JupyterLab.

More information are provided within the [ui-tests](./ui-tests/README.md) README.

## AI Coding Assistant Support

This project includes an `AGENTS.md` file with coding standards and best practices for JupyterLab extension development. The file follows the [AGENTS.md standard](https://agents.md) for cross-tool compatibility.

### Compatible AI Tools

`AGENTS.md` works with AI coding assistants that support the standard, including Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Aider, and others. For a current list of compatible tools, see [the AGENTS.md standard](https://agents.md).

### What's Included

The `AGENTS.md` file provides guidance on:

- Code quality rules and file-scoped validation commands
- Naming conventions for packages, plugins, and files
- Coding standards (TypeScript{% if kind.lower() == 'frontend-and-server' %}, Python, backend-frontend integration{% endif %})
- Development workflow and debugging{% if kind.lower() == 'frontend-and-server' %}
- Backend integration patterns (`APIHandler`, `requestAPI()`, routing){% endif %}{% if kind.lower() == 'theme' %}
- Theme-specific patterns (CSS organization, light/dark modes, `IThemeManager`){% endif %}{% if kind.lower() == 'mimerender' %}
- Renderer implementation (`IRenderMime.IExtension`, security, performance){% endif %}
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

### Tool-Specific Files

{% if create_claude_symlink or create_gemini_symlink %}This project includes symlinks for tool-specific compatibility:
{% if create_claude_symlink %}- `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md` (for Claude Code){% endif %}
{% if create_gemini_symlink %}- `GEMINI.md` → `AGENTS.md` (for Gemini Code Assist){% endif %}

{% endif %}

**Additional symlinks** can be created manually if needed:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md     # For Claude Code
ln -s AGENTS.md GEMINI.md     # For Gemini Code Assist
```

```
# On Windows (Command Prompt, run as Administrator)
mklink CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md
mklink GEMINI.md AGENTS.md
```

```powershell
# On Windows (PowerShell, run as Administrator)
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "CLAUDE.md" -Target "AGENTS.md"
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "GEMINI.md" -Target "AGENTS.md"
```

**Other conventions** you might encounter:
- `.cursorrules` - Cursor's YAML/JSON format (Cursor also supports AGENTS.md natively)
- `CONVENTIONS.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` - For CodeConventions.ai and GitHub bots
- Project-specific rules in JetBrains AI Assistant settings

All tool-specific files should be symlinks to `AGENTS.md` as the single source of truth.

### Customization

You can edit `AGENTS.md` to add project-specific conventions or adjust guidelines to match your team's practices. The file uses plain Markdown with Do/Don't patterns and references to actual project files.
